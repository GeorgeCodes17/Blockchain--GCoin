Database is called GeoCoin
Table names: wallet_info and transactions_info

Do we need AUTOINCREMENT?

Description of data types for columns of tables:

_____wallets_info_____

# Mark keys as used when are encased in <> (and longer length)
 addresses as used when they have a preceding- 11 (and longer length)
 mark transaction id as latest block in chain with preceding- 99 (and longer length)

$ wallet_id- is INTEGER primary key as the table needs a unique identifier for
each record
$ wallet_name is TEXT so can include numbers and letters so if one wants a number
in their name it is allowed
$ GCoin_amount is REAL so can record how much currency the user has currently
needs to be REAL so can store decimal values
$ no_of_transactions is INTEGER so can store this info for the user to view, if
interested and only needs to be to 0 decimal places
$ public_keys are TEXT so can store numbers and letters of codes
$ private_keys are TEXT so can store numbers and letters of codes
$ addresses are INTEGER so can store just numbers as i wanted this to be different
to the aforementioned keys
$ passnumber is INTEGER as only needs to be numbers so is correct type, min length- 6
$ date_of_creation is TEXT as can store it with letters or just numbers, and
when extracted will be good as will already be a str() so won't have to change
it to int() (which i'd probably have to do) for manipulation

_____transactions_info_____


# Can track exactly who is sendee and sender because of the addresses in use
$ transaction_id is INTEGER and PRIMARY KEY as unique identifier needed and
should be a number i reckon. Also transaction_id is our hash for connecting blocks
in the chain. there are no 9s in this unless it is to represent that the current
transaction id is the latest one. 10 digits long when is a previous block.
$ sender_wallet_name is TEXT so can be number and letters for storing the name
of wallet sent from in particular transaction
$ sender_address is INTEGER as the addresses are integers for all users
$ receiver_wallet_name is TEXT so can be number and letters for storing the name
of wallet sent to in particular transaction
$ receiver_address is INTEGER as the addresses are integers for all users
$ transaction_amount is REAL as the amount is an integer but will have decimal
places so REAL works as a FLOAT for this
$ date_of_transaction is more important than date of wallet creation will be nice
to see a record of whens for the user. This is TEXT so can store for easy
manipulation, as seen above, and can have str() and/or int()s depending
on how i want to format the database input
