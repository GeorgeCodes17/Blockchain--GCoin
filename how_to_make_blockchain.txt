Ingredients- i will need:

A hashing function- always return same length of output, always the same for a given input

Create wallet funct- which allows to allocate a name,
Makes seed phrase (-https://medium.com/bitbees/python-code-to-manually-create-12-24-worded-seed-and-passphrase-without-trusting-bitcoin-wallets-9d158535dfc6)
and calls below

Function that (can be called manually) called as well as in above funct- if creating new wallet,
creates 4 pub and priv keys and addresses. Otherwise, when called will create 1 set of keys and address

A way to login- a CryptoWallet: with private keys to allow entry


Database- where each record stores info about a wallet's: id, Name, GCoin amount, number of transactions, 
pub keys, priv keys, and addresses, password, date of creation
Present a user's info by retrieving all of it from the above

Database- storing all transactions and their infos: transaction (hash) id- - prev hash (4chars) + transaction id (manipulated in some way- (8chars)) + new hash id (4chars)), 
sender wallet name, sender address, receiver wallet name, receiver address, transaction amount, date of transaction
This is our blockchain, connected via the hash ids

Add our genesis block in transactions history database

Login function


Send money function- ***below***
How will send money:  

To verify legitimacy of transaction- Generate six digit code and send to email address 
Enter that code + x, x, x positions in private key for send money. No need to verify when receive money, only private key 
needed to accept money sent to them


If the user's wallet has enough GCoin to send the stated amount then:
	Allow entry of sender and receiver addresses into program and have them processed so,

	Enter the receiver's address associated with their chosen private key

	In database of people's wallets locate the wallet name from the addresses -> public key -> private key -> wallet name, 
	I think and increment and decrement the aforementioned amount,
	Increment the number of transactions and 
	Create new key pair + address
	In database of transactions (our Blockchain) add a new record of transaction

Each block contains transaction info- transaction id, sender- address, receiver- address, GCoin amount


Genesis block has a hash- identify block and contents. If hash changes the block has had info change
2ND block contains its hash and hash of Genesis
3RD block contains its hash and hash of 2nd
